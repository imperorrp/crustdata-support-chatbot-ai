### Building the Company/People Search Criteria Filter

Based on the field on you are filtering, filters can be categorized into 3 different categories

- **Text Filter**
    
    A **text filter** is used to filter based on specific text values. Each **text filter** must contain **filter_type**, **type** and list of **value**.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    {
      "filter_type": "COMPANY_HEADCOUNT",
      "type": "in",
      "value": ["10,001+", "1,001-5,000"]
    }
    ```
    
    **Valid** `type`**:**
    
    - `in`: To include values.
    - `not in`: To exclude values. Excluding values might not be supported for every filter.
- **Range Filter**
    
    A **range filter** is used to filter based on a range of values. Each filter must contain **filter_type**, **type** and **value**. Few range filters might contain a **sub_filter**. Ensure that you correctly pass **sub_filter** if required.
    
    **sub_filter**
    
    The **sub_filter** is an optional field that provides additional context for the range filter. For example, with the `DEPARTMENT_HEADCOUNT` filter, the **sub_filter** specifies which department the filter applies to. Ensure that you correctly pass **sub_filter** if required.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    {
      "filter_type": "ANNUAL_REVENUE",
      "type": "between",
      "value": {"min": 1, "max": 500},
      "sub_filter": "USD"
    }
    ```
    
    **Valid** `type`**:**
    
    - `between`: To specify a range of values, indicating that the value must fall within the defined minimum and maximum limits.
- **Boolean Filter**
    
    A **boolean filter** is used to filter based on true/false values. It doesn't contain any **type** or **value**
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```
    {
      "filter_type": "IN_THE_NEWS"
    }
    ```
    

And here is the full dictionary for filter attributes and possible values you can pass:

### **Making Requests**

- **Request**:
    
    ### **Request Body:**
    
    The request body can have the following keys (atleast one of them is required)
    
    - `linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url` (optional): URL of the Sales Navigator Accounts search from the browser
    - `filters` (optional): JSON dictionary defining the search criteria as laid out by the [Crustdata filter schema](https://www.notion.so/Crustdata-Discovery-And-Enrichment-API-c66d5236e8ea40df8af114f6d447ab48?pvs=21).
    - `page` (optiona): Only valid when `filters` is not empty. When passing `linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url`, page should be specified in `linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url` itself
    
    ### Examples
    
    - **Via LinkedIn Sales Navigator URL:**
        
        ```bash
        curl --location 'https://api.crustdata.com/screener/company/search' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
        --header 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
        --header 'Authorization: Token $auth_token' \
        --data '{
            "linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/company?query=(filters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AD%2Ctext%3A51-200%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AREGION%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A103323778%2Ctext%3AMexico%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A25%2Ctext%3AManufacturing%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))))&sessionId=8TR8HMz%2BTVOYaeivK9p%2Bpg%3D%3D&viewAllFilters=true"
        }'
        ```
        
    
    **Via Custom Search Filters:**
    
    Refer [Building the Company/People Search Criteria Filter](https://www.notion.so/Building-the-Company-People-Search-Criteria-Filter-116e4a7d95b180528ce4f6c485a76c40?pvs=21) to build the custom search filter for your query and pass it in the `filters` key. Each element of `filters` is a JSON object which defines a filter on a specific field. All the elements of `filters` are joined with a logical “AND” operation when doing the search.
    
    Example:
    
    This query retrieves people from companies with a headcount between `1,001-5,000` or more than `10,001+`, with annual revenue between `1` and `500 million USD`, excluding those located in the `United States`, and returns the second page of results.
    
    ```bash
    curl --location 'https://api.crustdata.com/screener/company/search' \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
    --header 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
    --header 'Authorization: Token $token' \
    --data '{
        "filters": [
            {
                "filter_type": "COMPANY_HEADCOUNT",
                "type": "in",
                "value": ["10,001+", "1,001-5,000"]
            },
            {
                "filter_type": "ANNUAL_REVENUE",
                "type": "between",
                "value": {"min": 1, "max": 500},
                "sub_filter": "USD"
            },
            {
                "filter_type": "REGION",
                "type": "not in",
                "value": ["United States"]
            }
        ],
        "page": 2
    }'
    ```
    
- **Response**:
    
    https://jsonhero.io/j/zn02zfopXQas
    
- **Key points:**
    - **Credits:** Each page request costs 25 credits
    - **Pagination:** If the total number of results for the query is more than 25 (value of `total_display_count` param), you can paginate the response in the following ways (depending on your request)
        - When passing `linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url` :
            - adding `page` query param to `linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url` . For example, to get data on `n` th page, `linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url` would become `https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/company?page=n&query=...` .
                - Example request with `page=2`
                    
                    ```bash
                    curl --location 'https://api.crustdata.com/screener/person/search' \
                    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
                    --header 'Accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
                    --header 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.9' \
                    --header 'Authorization: Token $auth_token' \
                    --data '{
                        "linkedin_sales_navigator_search_url": "https://www.linkedin.com/sales/search/company?page=2&query=(filters%3AList((type%3ACOMPANY_HEADCOUNT%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3AD%2Ctext%3A51-200%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))%2C(type%3AINDUSTRY%2Cvalues%3AList((id%3A25%2Ctext%3AManufacturing%2CselectionType%3AINCLUDED)))))&sessionId=8TR8HMz%2BTVOYaeivK9p%2Bpg%3D%3D"
                    }'
                    ```
                    
        - When passing `filters` :
            - provide `page` as one of the keys in the payload itsefl
                - Example request with `page=2`
                    
                    ```bash

        Each page returns upto 25 results. To fetch all the results from a query, you should keep on iterating over pages until you cover the value of `total_display_count` in the response from first page.
        
    - **Latency:** The data is fetched in real-time from Linkedin and the latency for this endpoint is between 10 to 30 seconds.
    - **Response schema:** Because the data is fetched realtime, and the results may not be in Crustdata’s database already, the response schema will be different from c[ompany data enrichment endpoint](https://www.notion.so/116e4a7d95b180bc9dd0d9acac03ddd4?pvs=21) `screener/company` . But all the results will be added to Crustdata’s database in 60 min of your query and the data for a specific company profile can be enriched via [company enrichment endpoint](https://www.notion.so/116e4a7d95b180bc9dd0d9acac03ddd4?pvs=21)
